					    version 0.2
				

	The following file describes each setting that could be set in acc.conf(the name is constant and thus no other names are accepted to use for configuration file) to use with Accountant. This file should be in the same directory in which the program is. It consists of setting name equal sign and a value - all these on the same line. 
	First its written the name of the setting (it should be typed as is shown if you want the program to read the value) and then is given the value range ([x-y] from x to y; [a b c ...] a or b or c) as well as the default value that will be set if the specified value in acc.conf file is out of range or the setting is not present. The order in which you type the settings doesn't matter.


lines_per_page = [1-200], default: 0

	1. The number of lines(records) displayed per page when show list and show 
	filtered list invoked. Use 0(zero) to disable the function.
	
	
date_separator_char = [/ , \ : -], default: '-'

	2. Used to separate the numbers of a date. Example formats are: 21-5-2007, 21.5.2007,
	21\5\2007, 21/5/2007, 21:5:2007. Only the chars showed above are allowed. The char may be
	quoted: "/".
	
	
use_iso_date_format = [1 (true) or 0 (false)], default: 1

	3. Determines the order in which date digits are shown. ISO format: Day-Month-Year. 
	Non ISO (US) format: Year-Month-Day.
	
	
value_precision = [0-6], default: 2

	4. Used in list to show digits with the precision given as value. Also digits entered in
	value field will be trimmed to the precision of the setting.
	
	
export_all_path = [valid file name], default: 'export_all.txt'
export_income_path = [valid file name], default: 'export_income.txt'
export_outcome_path = [valid file name], default: 'export_outcome.txt'

	5,6,7. These three settings are used to set paths in which export data will be saved. 
	They are used by the Export to txt part of the program. The names may be quoted: 
	"file name".
	
	
set_new_IDs_on_appload = [1 (true) or 0 (false)], default: 0

	8. When the program starts it loads all the records from the database in the RAM. So its
	possible to give the records new ID numbers corresponding to their number in the file. For 
	example record five will have ID = 5. But on the other hand it will be difficult for 
	you to remember new IDs each time and thus you may prefer to turn off this option.
	
	
last_database_used = [valid file name], default: 'main.adb'

	9. This setting is used extensively by the program. Each time you open or create new DB
	its name is stored in the value of the setting. When the program loads the DB pointed by the 		name is loaded. You can change this manually but have to ensure you are giving valid 
	file names. Quotes around the name of the file are allowed.
	
	
last_filter_expression = [valid filter expression], default: not set

	10. This setting is also changed by the program and you can edit it manually. Its used to 
	to filter all the data in some meaningful way. For more info check the file 
	"FILTER EXPRESSIONS_v0.1.TXT"
	
showlist:remember_last_shown = [1 (true) or 0 (false)], default: 0

	11. List data preview is very powerful. It remembers the last page you have viewed and the
	next time you open for example Show list > Income records it will show you the page you
	last were looking at. This setting controls weather the program to remember that page and
	the next time you start it and open the list, record preview will begin from the saved page.

showfilteredlist:remember_last_shown = [1 (true) or 0 (false)], default: 0

	12. That setting is very similar to showlist:remember_last_shown (see above). The difference
	is that it remembers the pages viewed in the Filtered list. You can have this setting turned 		off (0) without affecting the showlist:remember_last_shown and vice versa.
