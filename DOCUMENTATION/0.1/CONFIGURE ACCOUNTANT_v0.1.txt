					    version 0.1
				

	The following files describes each setting that could be set in acc.conf(the name is constant and thus no other names are accepted to use with config file) file to use with Accountant. This file should be in the same directory in which the program is. It consists of setting name equal sign and value all these one per line. First its written the name of the setting (it should be typed as is shown if you want the program to read the value) and then is given the value range ([x-y] from x to y; [a b c ...] a or b or c) as well as the default value that will be set if the specified value in acc.conf file is out of range or the setting is not present. The order in which you type the settings doesn't matter.


lines_per_page = [1-200], default: 0

	1. The number of lines(records) displayed per page when show list and show 
	filtered list invoked. Use 0(zero) to disable the function.
	
	
date_separator_char = [/ , \ : -], default: '-'

	2. Used to separate the numbers of a date. Example formats are: 21-5-2007, 21.5.2007,
	21\5\2007, 21/5/2007, 21:5:2007. Only the chars showed above are allowed.
	
	
use_iso_date_format = [1 (true) or 0 (false)], default: 1

	3. Determines the order in which date digits are shown. ISO format: Day-Month-Year. 
	Non ISO (US) format: Year-Month-Day.
	
	
value_precision = [0-6], default: 2

	4. Used in list to show digits with the precision given as value. Also digits entered in
	value field will be trimmed to the precision of the setting.
	
	
export_all_path = [valid file name], default: 'export_all.txt'
export_income_path = [valid file name], default: 'export_income.txt'
export_outcome_path = [valid file name], default: 'export_outcome.txt'

	5,6,7. These three settings are used to set paths in which export data will be saved. 
	They are used by the Export to txt part of the program.
	
	
set_new_IDs_on_appload = [1 (true) or 0 (false)], default: 0

	8. When the program starts it loads all the records from the database in the RAM. So its
	possible to give the records new ID numbers corresponding to their number in the file. For 
	example record five will have ID = 5. But on the other hand it will be difficult for 
	you to remember new IDs each time and thus you may prefer to turn off this option.
	
	
last_database_used = [valid file name], default: 'main.adb'

	9. This setting is used extensively by the program. Each time you open or create new DB
	its name is stored in the value of the setting. When the program loads the DB pointed by the 		name is loaded. You can change this manually but have to ensure you are giving valid 
	file names.
	
	
last_filter_expression = [valid filter expression], default: not set

	10. This setting is also changed by the program and you can edit it manually. Its used to 
	to filter all the data in some meaningful way. For more info check the file 
	"FILTER EXPRESSIONS_v0.1.TXT"
